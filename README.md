## A Little About Me

For 8+ years, I’ve combined a human-centric approach with a knack for solving complex problems in the tech world. Today, as a **Solutions Engineer** at a SaaS company, I collaborate closely with web and mobile developers, helping them fully leverage our platform. Whether it’s pinpointing elusive bugs, guiding best practices for SEO, or optimizing apps for better ASO outcomes, I’m there to ensure they hit their performance and visibility goals. Think of me as a friendly detective and strategic advisor, turning technical hurdles into growth opportunities. 🐛🔍🚀

I’ve also spent time diving into **Full-Stack Development**, finding joy in seeing a product from every angle, and I’m passionate about **iOS Mobile Development** with **Swift** & **SwiftUI**. Nothing beats blending technical expertise with empathy to build solutions that feel as personal and supportive as a great conversation.

- **Human-Centered Dev 🤝:** With a background in communication, I never forget the people behind the screens—everything I build or advise on aims to elevate their experience.
- **SwiftUI Enthusiast 🚀:** Crafting interfaces that feel effortless, intuitive, and beautifully designed.

## Current Adventures
